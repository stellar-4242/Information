## Introduction

  >   I'm a Lua developer with over 5 years of experience, I host a discord server with over 9,000 members where I release free scripts annually. I'll leave examples of my work below.
> You're probably wondering, my area of expertise. I'm a man of many talents, I have back-end development experience with JavaScript for Roblox Studio hosting events for Server   to Server communication. This can be used for, managing group ranks live ( user attends a training, server automatically ranks the individual ). My back-end development experience could also be used for live communication between the Server and a Hosted WebServer.

### Specifics

  > With that being said, I'm primarily a security engineer. I have unique creations never seen before on roblox, example being a custom executor detection it's able to detect > popular exploits such as (Synapse X, ProtoSmasher, RCM, ScriptWareV2, Sentinel), my method doesn't involve the now public method using MemoryTags.  Another example being a custom interface injection detection, CIIJD for short. CIIJD is used to detect various instances a exploiter will instance on their client, although their have been previous methods many of them have been patched by the Roblox Studio client, CIIJD uses a completely unique method, created by me.

### Summary
> In short I'm a experienced Lua developer who can script anything you can imagine. I'm also a H1 hacktivist with 1 vulnerability reported @ https://hackerone.com/roblox
